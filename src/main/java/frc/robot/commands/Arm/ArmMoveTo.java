/*
 * comments form Mr.L
 * 
 * Dont think in terms of MoveOut, MoveIn, one command should handle both.
 * 
 * Think in terms of moveTo.  Arm is at X,Y,Z and we want it at X2, Y2,Z2.
 * 
 * It's hard to start commands without a sub-sys API, focus on that.
 * 
 * I've added a few hints and cleanups/.

 /* I found some measerments relating to the ammount of rotations
 * Its 22 inches from the center of the april tag to the center of the cone node
 * The Robot wheel has a circumfrence of aproximately 12.57
 * Dividing those out we get 1.75 rotations
 * We dont know the exact gear ratios, so we will be using X (The current idea is 8.5)
